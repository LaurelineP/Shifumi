                    <h3>Culture level up</h3>
                    <p>"Rock, paper, scissors" in english, "Pierre, Papier (‚â† Feuille), Ciseaux" in french, "Jan-Ken-Pon" or "Janken!" in japanese or also know as "Shifumi" is a child but also an adult game.
                    Dispite the duality aspect of the game it is also played for decisional purpose: let's ask the following question: "Who's washing the dishes tonight ?" Uh ?
                    You don't want to but neither your roommate or partner, so "Who?" is the question ! Let's settle that with the Shifumi game then! </p>

                    <p>The origins of this game is mainly from the Asian culture as we could imagine and appearing in the 19th, but why "Shifumi" ?
                        "Shifumi" actually came from "Hi-Fu-Mi", which corresponds to "hito" (one) "futa" (two) and "misu" (three) in japanese even though, in Japan the game is named Jan-Ken-Pon or Janken as mentionned earlier.
                        But ...( always a "but" üòâ ) according to a Xi√® Zh√†ozh√¨ book, the lords from the Han dynasty were playing a similar game named "sh«íush√¨l√¨ng".
                        That's it for your culture G today. Enjoy the game!
                    </p>
